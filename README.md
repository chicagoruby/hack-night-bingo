# B•I•N•G•O

BINGO is a game of chance in which each player matches numbers printed in different arrangements on 5×5 cards which the numbers the game host (caller) draws at random, marking the selected numbers with tiles.

The game is won when a player marks their board in a specific pattern, usually a straight line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally across five spaces. Don't forget to yell "BINGO!"

## The Challenge

We are going to split this out into mini-chalenges.

### Card generator

Using classic BINGO spaces (B-I-N-G-O 1-75), generate BINGO cards. Don't forget about the free space in the center of the card!

Once you have created your classic boards, try allowing board generation using a custom list. You can allow users to input the list themselves, or find a set of data (for example, "US Cities") to pass to your application.

### BINGO caller

Did you know that MacOS includes a command, `say`, that will verbalize commands. Use this functionality to create a caller that will call out BINGO spaces.

### Putting it all together...

Create a fully functioning BINGO game that generates a board, calls spaces, and allows users to mark the spaces as they are called. Make an AI version that marks the board for you. 

You can build this as a web app or a terminal app.
